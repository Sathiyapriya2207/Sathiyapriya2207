        <p> Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, 
            birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy.
                For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another..
